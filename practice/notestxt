Here are some Python programming questions for you to practice and strengthen your basics:

//day1
1. Basic Syntax
Write a program to print the following:
css
Copy
Edit
Hello, [Your Name]!
Welcome to Python programming.
2. Variables and Input
Write a program to accept a user’s name and age, then print:
css
Copy
Edit
Your name is [name] and you are [age] years old.
3. If-Else Conditions
Write a program to check if a number entered by the user is odd or even.
4. Loops
Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
Write a program to calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a while loop.
5. Functions
Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
6. List and Loop
Create a list of 5 fruits and print each fruit on a new line using a loop.
7. Dictionary Practice
Create a dictionary with three key-value pairs (e.g., "name": "Alice", "age": 25). Write a program to print all the keys and their values.
8. Working with Strings
Write a program to reverse a string entered by the user.
9. File Handling
Create a text file, write "Hello, Python!" into it, then read and print its content.
10. Modules
Use the math module to calculate the square root of a number entered by the user.
Let me know which ones you'd like to work on, or if you'd like help solving any of them!

Beginner-Level Questions (Warm-Up)
Swap Two Numbers Without Using a Temporary Variable
Write a Python program to swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.

Check Prime Number
Write a Python program that takes a number as input and checks if it is a prime number.

Sum of Digits in a Number
Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits.
Example: Input 123 → Output 6 (1 + 2 + 3 = 6).

Factorial Using Loop
Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number using a loop.

Reverse a String Without Using Slicing
Write a Python program to reverse a string without using slicing (e.g., [::-1]).

Intermediate-Level Questions
Count Vowels and Consonants in a String
Write a Python program that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels and consonants. Ignore spaces and special characters.
Example: Input hello world → Output Vowels: 3, Consonants: 7.

Fibonacci Sequence
Write a Python program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.
Example: Input n=5 → Output 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.

Find the Largest Number in a List
Write a Python program to find the largest number in a list without using the built-in max() function.
Example: Input [3, 5, 7, 2, 8] → Output 8.

Advanced Challenge
Palindrome Checker (String or Number)
Write a Python program to check if a given string or number is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Example: Input madam → Output Palindrome.

Number Guessing Game
Create a simple number guessing game. The program should:

Pick a random number between 1 and 100.
Let the user guess the number.
Provide feedback (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low") until the user guesses correctly.
